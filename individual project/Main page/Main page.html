<div class="content">In other word, <span>Hypertext markup language (HTML)</span> is a markup language designed for web creation and other information that can be seen in Web browsers. <br><br>
   <h2>Origin</h2>
   The <strong>essence</strong> of web pages is <span>hypertext markup language</span>, which can create powerful web pages by using other Web technologies (such as scripting language, public gateway interface, components and so on). Therefore, <span>hypertext markup language</span> is the foundation of the world wide web (Web) programming, that is to say, the world wide web is based on hypertext. <span>Hypertext markup language</span> is called <strong>hypertext markup language</strong> because the text contains the so-called "hyperlink" point.<br>
   <h2>Definiton</h2>
  <span>Hypertext markup language</span> is an application of standard general markup language. It is also a standard. It marks all parts of the web page which is <strong>displayed by mark symbol</strong>. Web page file itself is a text file, <strong>by adding markup in the text file, you can tell the browser how to display the contents</strong> (such as: how the text processing, how to arrange the picture, how to display the picture, etc.). The browser reads the web page in sequence, and then explains and displays the contents of the tag according to the token. 
  <br><strong>For different browsers, there may be different interpretations of the same token, which may have different display effects.</strong>
  <h2>Writing style</h2>
  <span>HTML</span> is actually <strong>text</strong>, and it needs browser explanation. <span>HTML</span> can use <strong>basic text, document editing software, or Microsoft's own notepad</strong> to write. <strong>But you must use .Htm or .Html as extensions when you save it</strong>, so that browsers can recognize and interpret directly.
